# Tikka — Decentralized Raffle Platform on Stellar

This repository is the **Tikka ecosystem**: frontend, SDK, backend, indexer, and oracle. Soroban smart contracts (Rust) live in a **separate repo/folder** and are not included here.

## Packages

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| [**client**](./client/) | Consumer web app — React 19, Vite, TypeScript. Reads from backend, writes via SDK. |
| [**sdk**](./sdk/) | NestJS library for Soroban contract interaction (tx build, simulate, sign, submit). Published as `@tikka/sdk`. |
| [**backend**](./backend/) | API layer — auth (SIWS), metadata, indexer merge, notifications. NestJS, Fastify, Supabase. |
| [**indexer**](./indexer/) | Blockchain event ingestion — Horizon → decode → PostgreSQL (+ Redis cache). NestJS. |
| [**oracle**](./oracle/) | Randomness oracle — listens for draw requests, computes VRF/PRNG, submits to contract. NestJS. |
